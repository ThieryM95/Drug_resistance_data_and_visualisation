# Drug_resistance_data_and_visualisation

This repository is the first release of the data and code to visualise the data for:

In the study mentioned above, we have developed a disease modelling approach with emulator-based global sensitivity analysis to systematically quantify which factors drive the establishment and spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites.

This repository contains the data generated during this study and the R scripts used to visualise the data. The repository is structured based on the figure's name in the manuscript. Each figure has a folder with its name. In the folder, there is the data and code used to generate the figure and a PDF version of the figure.

Note that the plotting code uses the folder structure and working directories used by the researchers. The file paths will have to be adjusted to replicate figures.
